# Neural-Network

Neural networks are a type of machine learning models which are designed to operate similar to human nervous system. These models are used to work on complex patterns and relationships that exists within a labelled dataset. 

They have following properties:

The core architecture of a Neural Network model is comprised of a large number of simple processing nodes called Neurons which are interconnected and organized in the form of differnt layers.

An individual node in a layer is connected to several other nodes in the previous and the next layer. The inputs form one layer are received and processed to generate the output which is passed to the next layer.

The first layer of this architecture is often named as input layer which accepts the inputs, the last layer is named as the output layer which produces the output and every other layer between input and output layer is named is hidden layers.
